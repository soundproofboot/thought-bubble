## Installation
Clone this repo, run ```npm i``` to install dependencies, then run ```npm start```. Since there is no front end use Insomnia or Postman to interact with the database.

## Usage
As stated above, this project is only the back end for a hypothetical application. However, all methods and routes are in place for standard CRUD operations with a REST API so any app that used these database models could be set up on top of it.

## Contributing
The app is built with the npm packages Express and Mongoose, for the server and database respectively.
